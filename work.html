    <h1>Work</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      My research interest started with my undergraduate thesis on the gender pay gap in the livestreaming industry.
      That project made me realize how powerful—and fun—it can be to play with data and explore fascinating economic questions.
      At Berkeley, I’ve expanded those skills by applying machine learning and statistical methods to a range of real-world problems,
      from housing displacement and health risks to social trust and digital sentiment. You can find more of my projects below.
    </p>

    <!-- 1) Gender Pay Gap -->
    <div class="card">

        <div class="title">Gender Pay Gap in Livestreaming Industry</div>
        <hr class="rule">
        <p>
          I explored income inequality in livestream e-commerce using a dataset of over two million sessions.
          After cleaning the data and building regression models, I found that women, despite being more active on the platform,
          earned significantly less than men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gap narrowed with more followers, livestreaming experience, and MCN (talent agency) support.
          I also discovered a “same-gender audience effect”: female influencers tend to attract more female viewers,
          which boosts their sales.

    <!-- 2) Myanmar -->
    <div class="card">

      <div class="text-col">
        <div class="kicker">Myanmar Conflict Timeline and Maps</div>
        <div class="title">Forecasting Political Violence in Myanmar</div>
        <hr class="rule">
        <p>
          I used Difference-in-Differences (DiD) to study how government interventions in religious and ethnic affairs can intensify conflict,
          focusing on the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. I used Rakhine State as a case study and compared trends in civilian casualties before and
          after the August 2017 clearance operation. I found that violence against civilians in Rakhine increased significantly relative to other regions
          after the policy was implemented, suggesting a targeted impact on the local Muslim population.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then trained a Random Forest model using conflict-related features—such as violence type, actor behavior, and recent fatalities—to forecast weekly harm.
          I found that while the model performed well in pre-policy periods, it failed to predict the surge in violence after 2017, suggesting that a significant shift
          in conflict dynamics—likely triggered by a regime policy change—rendered past patterns less predictive.

    <!-- 3) Housing -->

        <div class="kicker">California Housing Price Decline Map</div>
        <div class="title">Displacement Risk and Housing Price Volatility</div>
        <hr class="rule">
        <p>
          I used ACS Census data and home price indices to examine how rental patterns and housing price volatility interacted across California counties during the 2007–2009 crisis.
          I created density plots to compare the distribution of rental rates in high-volatility and low-volatility areas, and mapped price declines using county-level choropleths.
          I found that regions with larger drops in housing prices tended to have more uneven rental distributions—suggesting a higher risk of displacement.
          Economic shocks appeared to make housing less stable for renters in already vulnerable areas.
